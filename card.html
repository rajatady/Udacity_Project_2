        <p>The term "domestic dog" is generally used for both domesticated and feral varieties. The English word dog
            comes from Middle English dogge, from Old English docga, a "powerful dog breed".[10] The term may possibly
            derive from Proto-Germanic *dukkōn, represented in Old English finger-docce ("finger-muscle").[11] The word
            also shows the familiar petname diminutive -ga also seen in frogga "frog", picga "pig", stagga "stag", wicga
            "beetle, worm", among others.[12] The term dog may ultimately derive from the earliest layer of
            Proto-Indo-European vocabulary.[13]</p>
